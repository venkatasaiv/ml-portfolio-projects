# Recommendation System Projects

This folder contains recommendation system machine learning projects using public datasets and original code.

## Guidelines
- All code is original and self-written
- Only public, well-known datasets are used (e.g., MovieLens, Amazon Product Data, Last.fm Dataset)
- No copyrighted content or proprietary datasets
- Free of AI watermarks, plagiarism, or license violations

## Structure
Each project will include:
- `README.md` - Project description and instructions
- `data/` - Data preprocessing scripts (datasets downloaded separately)
- `src/` - Original source code
- `models/` - Saved model files
- `results/` - Output visualizations and metrics

## Future Projects
- Movie recommendation system with collaborative filtering
- Content-based recommendation engine
- Hybrid recommendation systems
- Matrix factorization techniques
- Deep learning for recommendations
