# Image Classification Projects

This folder contains image classification machine learning projects using public datasets and original code.

## Guidelines
- All code is original and self-written
- Only public, well-known datasets are used (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Fashion-MNIST)
- No copyrighted content or proprietary datasets
- Free of AI watermarks, plagiarism, or license violations

## Structure
Each project will include:
- `README.md` - Project description and instructions
- `data/` - Data preprocessing scripts (datasets downloaded separately)
- `src/` - Original source code
- `models/` - Saved model files
- `results/` - Output visualizations and metrics

## Future Projects
- CIFAR-10 classification with CNN
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Custom dataset classification
